### The problem

There are many feature-rich general SaaS software such as AirTable, ClickUp, monday.com, etc. that provide "building-blocks" for non-technical people to put together solutions to organise data better, create automated workflows, etc. that make them more productive.

Non-technical people, however, find it overwhelming to put together a solution / workflow to solve their problem using the software they find. 

They generally watch tutorial videos on YouTube to see how someone else has put together a workflow and then try to apply what they learn to their situation.
(The easiest way to learn to do something is to see how someone in your situation is solving the problem you face.)

### How does `solved` help with this?

`solved` is meant to be a video search site for tutorial videos of how people apply SaaS apps to their situation to make them more productive.

You can find your industry / occupation (which is like a subreddit) and see other people's workflows which they use to make them more productive.
